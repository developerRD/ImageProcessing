# ImageProcessing

In this project, I captured an image using the raspberry pi camera, applied some image processing techniques, and calculated the refraction index based on the detected coordinates.

When the codes run, first a camera starts running and you can see some spots on the camera that shows you how to take the picture in order to get the correct results.
In order to work with this code and measure the refractive index for liquids, you need a laser pointer and liquid in a glass cup that can be shown in the pictures.

It's still a good practice to perform additional testing and validation to ensure the code's reliability across a wider range of scenarios or input variations.
